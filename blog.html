        <h1>Question-1: Difference between Localstorage and Sessionstorage?</h1>
        <h3>Answer:- </h3>
        <p>Session and local storage are browser storage methods that let you store data alongside stateless HTTP
            requests. They are an alternative to cookie-based storage and have many uses in web development. Local and
            session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They allow a website
            to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on.</p>

        <h3>Answer:- </h3>
        <p>Global scope â€” Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block
            simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples
            of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible
            from anywhere in the code.
            Block Scope: A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops, are
            accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the curly
            braces are called as within block scope.</p>
