        <h1>Question-1: Difference between Localstorage and Sessionstorage?</h1>
        <h3>Answer:- </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Session and local storage are browser storage methods that let you store data alongside stateless HTTP
                requests. They are an alternative to cookie-based storage and have many uses in web development. Local
                and
                session storage are JavaScript APIs that you can use to store data on the client-side. They allow a
                website
                to store data on the browser and instruct the browser to access it later on.

        <h1>Question-2: Difference between Global scope and Block scope?</h1>
        <h3>Answer:- </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Global scope:- Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block
                simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are
                examples
                of structure that create a code block. A global variable has global scope. A global variable is
                accessible
                from anywhere in the code.</li>
            <li>
                Block Scope:- A variable when declared inside the if or switch conditions or inside for or while loops,
                are
                accessible within that particular condition or loop. To be consise the variables declared inside the
                curly
                braces are called as within block scope.

        <h1>Question-3: How does the eventloop workes in JavaScript?</h1>
        <h3>Answer:-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code,
                collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from
                models
                in other languages like C and Java.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Question-4: How many types of showing the undefined?</h1>
        <h3>Answer:-</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Variable that is not initialized will give undefine.</li>
            <li> When we decleare a function without return.</li>
            <li> When the parameter that is not passed will be undefine.</li>
            <li> If return has nothing on the right side will return undefine.</li>
            <li> When property that does not exist on an object will give undefine.</li>
            <li> Accessing array elements outside of the index range.</li>
            <li> Deleteing an element inside an array.</li>
